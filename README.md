**`Digital Craftsman (Dev/Editor/Videomaker)`**

I am a Software Engineering student, passionate about technology and activities that foster creativity, such as music, reading, and writing. All projects here are built from scratch, with only a few instructions provided by the professor/professional. I enjoy staying one step ahead, so I am always striving to learn something new‚Äîthis is my passion, not remaining stagnant or comfortable in one place.
